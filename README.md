# The Knesset Collaboration Network

## Introduction

The Knesset, Israel's legislative body, serves not only as a platform for policy-making and governance but also as a microcosm of the intricate social networks that underpin political life. Understanding the dynamics within the Knesset is essential for comprehending broader political processes and power structures in Israel. This research, conducted as part of the Social Network Analysis course at the University of Haifa, undertakes the Knesset Network Project, aiming to explore and reveal the hidden connections between members of the Knesset.

Network Analysis (NA) provides a powerful toolkit for examining relationships and interactions within a group. By employing advanced graph network algorithms, we can move beyond surface-level observations and delve into the complex web of affiliations, alliances, and informal connections that shape political behavior. This project leverages NA to analyze the ties between Knesset members, seeking to uncover patterns and insights that are not immediately apparent through conventional political analysis.

The objectives of this project are multifaceted. Firstly, we aim to identify clusters of closely connected members and understand the basis of their relationships based on their collaboration on bills submission. Secondly, we will examine the avrage centrality of this network as a measure for collaboration to determine how collaboration in the Knesset changed over time. Lastly, we will identify, based on the collaboration network,the main collaboration groups and we will explore the individuals who collaborate across those groups as the more interesting collaborations.

By illuminating the underlying social networks within the Knesset, this research aspires to provide a deeper understanding of Israel's political landscape. The findings could offer valuable insights into the dynamics of collaboration building, the spread of influence, and the potential for collaborative or contentious relationships among lawmakers. Ultimately, this project seeks to contribute to the broader field of political science by demonstrating the applicability and utility of Network Analysis in political research.
